description = "The operator has three input sides: Facing side [FS], plus side [PS], and minus side [MS] and one output side [OS]. The operator block's output level is based on the formula <i>FS + PS - MS</i><br>The magic happens when you chain a different component to the operator block. Placing certain components next to an operator block will override their behavior to favor certain operations<br><u>NPC Behavior</u><br><b>Repeater - Logic Gates</b><br>Placing it in the PS creates an 'and' gate using the formula <i>FS and MS</i><br>Placing it in the MS creates an 'xor' gate using the formula <i>FS xor PS</i><br><b>Capacitor - Comparisons</b><br>Placing it in the PS creates a 'greater than' comparison. The capacitor will only output energy based on the condition <i>FS + PS - MS > capacitance</i><br>Placing it in the MS creates a 'less than' comparison. The capacitor will only output energy based on the condition <i>FS + PS - MS &lt; capacitance</i><br>Placing it in the OS creates a 'equal to' comparison. The capacitor will only output energy based on the condition <i>FS + PS - MS = capacitance</i><br><b>Player Spyblock - Aggregates</b><br>Placing it in the PS creates a 'max' function using the formula <i>max(FS, MS)</i><br>Placing it in the MS creates a 'min' function using the formula <i>min(FS, PS)</i><br>Placing it in the OS creates a 'median' function using the formula <i>median(FS, PS, MS)</i><br><b>NPC Spyblock - Differential</b><br>Placing it in the PS creates an 'incremental' detector. The output is based in the formula <i>[FS + PS - MS](t) - [FS + PS - MS](t - 1) {x > 0}</i><br>Placing it in the MS creates a 'decremental' detector. The output is based in the formula <i>[FS + PS - MS](t - 1) - [FS + PS - MS](t) {x > 0}</i><br>Placing it in the OS creates an 'change' detector. The output is based in the formula <i>abs([FS + PS - MS](t) - [FS + PS - MS](t - 1))</i><br><b>Reaperblock - Inversion</b><br>When placed in the OS, the output is based on the formula <i> 15 - (FS + PS - MS)</i><br><b>Alternator - Turnout</b><br>When placed on the OS, the alternator will constantly emit power and only change direction when the operator block gets a pulse."
