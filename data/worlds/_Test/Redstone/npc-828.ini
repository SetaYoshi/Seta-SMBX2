description = "A command block can execute lunalua code when powered.<br><u>Behavior</u><br><b>Pulse</b><br>The code will only run once per pulse. This code is automatically wrapped in a routine, meaning you can use functions such as 'wait()' without needing to wrap it.<br><b>Repeating</b><br>Will execute the code every frame the command block is powered.<br><u>Environment</u><br>Inside the environment, you can access the following parameters:<br><b>commandBlock</b> The NPC object representing the command block<br><b>powerLevel</b> The energy level used to power the command block<br><b>powerLevelPrevious</b> The energy level of the command block, in the previous frame<br><b>powerDirection</b> The direction that was used to power the command block [0: left, 1: up, 2: right, 3: down]<br><b>script</b> A string copy of the code<br><br>Inside of the environment, you can automatically access the following libraries: redstone, luatime, RNG, math, Routine. Meaning that you can do <i>waitFrames()</i> directly instead of <i>Routine.waitFrames()</i><br>The redstone library has some helpful built-in functions, check the redstone.lua file for documentation.<br>You can also access the <i>reddata</i> table inside of this environment. This table is synchronized with all command blocks and control chips."
