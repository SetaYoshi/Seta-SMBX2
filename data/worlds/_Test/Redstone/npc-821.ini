description = "A transmitter sends wireless power into receivers. Wireless power behaves similarly to dust, in the case where wireless power loses energy for every block it travels.<br><u>Behavior</u><br><b>Repeaters</b>If wireless power hits a repeater, the repeater will repeat the wireless power back with power level 15.<br><b>Reflector</b>A reflector will reflect wireless power into a new direction.<br><b>Absorber</b>An absorber will absorb the wireless power preventing it form travelling beyond that point"
